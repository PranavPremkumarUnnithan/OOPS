        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code where we organize data and actions into objects.\n",
        "  - These objects are like real-world things; they have properties and actions.\n",
        "  - OOP helps make code easier to manage, reuse, and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class in OOP is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and actions that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An object in OOP is a thing created from a class.\n",
        "  - It has the properties and actions defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the important parts to the user.\n",
        "  - It helps to focus on what something does, not how it works.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation hides the data inside an object and controls how it is accessed or changed.\n",
        "  - It keeps data safe and organized by using private variables and public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python are special methods with double underscores at the start and end of their names.\n",
        "  - They let you define how objects behave with built-in functions or operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Inheritance in OOP is when a new class gets properties and actions from an existing class.\n",
        "  - The existing class is called the parent  class, and the new class is called the child class.\n",
        "  - The child class can use everything from the parent class and also add its own features or change some behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Polymorphism in OOP means the same action can behave differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It lets you use the same method name for different classes, but each class can have its own way of doing that action.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by hiding data and controlling access to it using private variables and methods.\n",
        " - Private Variables.\n",
        " - Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__ that runs automatically when you create a new object.\n",
        " - It is used to set up the object with initial values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods that behave differently from regular methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ClassMethod\n",
        "  - Belongs to the class, not the object.\n",
        "  - Takes cls as the first parameter refers.\n",
        "  - Can change class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Static Method\n",
        "   - Belongs to the class, but doesn’t use self or cls.\n",
        "   - Doesn’t access or change class or object data.\n",
        "   - Used for helper functions related to the class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   \n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "  - In Python, method overloading is not directly supported like in some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method overriding in OOP happens when a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class but gives it a new behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It allows the child class to change or customize how the method works.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a read-only attribute. It lets you access a method like it’s a variable, without using parentheses.\n",
        "  - This is useful when you want to control how data is accessed but still make it look simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it makes code more flexible and easier to manage.\n",
        "  \n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be used to create objects directly.\n",
        "  - It is like a template for other classes.\n",
        "  - It can have abstract methods that must be defined in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Organized Code\n",
        "  - Reusability\n",
        "  - Easier to Maintain\n",
        "  - Flexibility\n",
        "  - Security\n",
        "  - Real-World Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Class Variable and Instance Variable are both used to store data in a class, but they are different in how they are shared.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Class Variable:\n",
        " - Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
        " - Defined outside of methods, usually at the top of the class.\n",
        " - Changing it affects all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance Variable:\n",
        " - Unique to each object.\n",
        " - Defined inside the __init__ method using self.\n",
        " - Changing it affects only that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit features from more than one parent class.\n",
        "  - This allows the child class to use properties and methods from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods that define how an object is shown as a string.\n",
        "  - __str__:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Used to give a nice, readable description of the object.\n",
        "  - Called when you use print() or str().\n",
        "  - Meant for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - __repr__:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Gives a detailed, technical description for debugging.\n",
        "  - Called when you use repr() or in the Python shell.\n",
        "  - Meant for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It helps to reuse code and makes it easier to extend the behavior of the parent class without rewriting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be deleted or destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - @staticmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Does not access class or object data.\n",
        "  - Works like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "  - No self or cls parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  @classmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Can access and change class-level data.\n",
        "  - Takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance means that different child classes can have the same method name as the parent class, but each one behaves differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python means calling multiple methods on the same object in one line.\n",
        "  - Each method returns the object itself, allowing you to chain the next method right after.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python lets you make an object behave like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - When you define __call__ in a class, you can call the object using parentheses () like a function.\n",
        "\n",
